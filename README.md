# Forkify
Recipe finder app

This application searches for recipes based on a user-entered keyword. The search is performed asynchronously via an external API. The application is not responsive.

In this project I mainly practiced working with asynchronous JS (Promises and Async / Await). The application architecture is based on the MVC principle and uses the capabilities and advantages of ES6 modules.

During this project, I applied current development procedures, such as the use of the npm dependency management tool, the Babel compiler, the Parcel bundler, etc.
